Test prerequisites
------------------
GEMS:
  rake
  rspec
  test-unit

Tests
-----
Tests are done on various versions of Ruby, mostly on Windows
but also on Ubuntu. Some tests are 'fragile' in that they have
hard-coded (version specific) values that contain the expected
number of files cached. Obviously this depends on the exact
versions of the gems that are loaded. It's the only way I get
to spot off-by-one errors if things change...

Issues
------
Won't work as expected if unusual mangling of $LOAD_PATH is
done at run time.

Kernel.autoload is not tracked at the moment though Module.autoload is.
This is because the Kernel version seems not to like getting aliased.
The Module.autoload caches files at the time of the call, rather than
when the autoload occurs. This is because Ruby uses an internal version
of require within the autoload that cannot be patched. However if
$LOAD_PATH changes between these two points then we might cache the
wrong file.

Relative files (../lib/file) or absolute files (c:\x\y\z) won't be
cached.

TODO
----
# TODO: skip certain files?


DONE
----
DONE: Copy folders? (Vendorize.add_dir('cgi'))
DONE: Copy files? (Vendorize.add('test/unit/ui/fox/testrunner.rb') / Vendorize.add_requirable('test/unit/ui/tk/testrunner'))
DONE: Put in the drb example app
DONE: Sinatra
